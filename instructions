my instructions :
1.in each query you generate to answer the question,do put ` before the name of the table and ` after it
for example:
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as access_count
FROM `query_history`
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY access_count DESC
2.In case of group by query- you cannot order by column that is not on the group by field
for example the following query is not valid
SELECT user_name, COUNT(*) as run_count
FROM `query_history`
GROUP BY user_name
ORDER BY total_elapsed_time DESC;
3.dont use LIMIT key word
4.in case you want to use last month do:
SELECT DISTINCT user_name
FROM  `query_history`
WHERE start_time >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, 30);
5.in case of questions based on former answers use the answer result
